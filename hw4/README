Compile/run: Compile using "make", run executable with
"./hw4"

go into the unittests directory andcompile make with unittests test and run 
./unittests to test function

Program Purpose: This homework assignment provides functions to make 
a binary search tree and the driver uses the implementation to create
a mock tree 

Acknowledgements: 

Files: 
main.cpp: Driver provided for us 

BinarySearchTree.cpp: has all the implementation functions

BinartSearchTree.h: Interface for BST class

BinarySearchTree-unittests.cpp: unittests for BST with google tests

runalltests.cpp: driver for unit tests

Had help from Lawrence and Kevin

Data Structures:

structs of nodes pointing to two childs (structs of node)

Testing: 
I would write the function and then use google tests to test the function.
Therefore before moving on, I would know the function is working.

I would also comment out sections of the driver and compile and run to 
break the program into pieces as well.

As for writing the recursive functions, I would just write a little bit and
run it even when I know it was incomplete to diagnose more thoughrougly where
the errors were. for example, I would print the tree and if the right child
was prnted wrong, I knew I had to change the code having to point to that
right child.

Therefore when I finished writing all the functions and ran diff, it worked 
perfectly
