This homework assignment contains some files that can be helpful towards implementing project 2


FSTree.h		: interface of FSTree class  (used to explore file directories)
FSTree.o		: compiled version of FSTree.cpp
DirNode.h 		: interface of DirNode class (nodes used in FSTree)
DirNode.o 		: compiled version of DirNode.cpp
hashExample.cpp : an example on how to use the hash function (and compression) with STL library
the_gerp		: compiled solution of this assignment (good for comparing purposes)
README 			: this file

I collaborated with Ozan for my design doc:

I will implement a hash table and for each indexed position have a pointer to a
FSTree and queries will first go throught the hash table and then search in the
FSTree class.

I will have an index class that does the hashing and compressing

I will also have a query class that includes the index class to handle query
cases

failed:

could not get proper output on FSTreeTraversal
